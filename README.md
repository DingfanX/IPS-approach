# IPS-approach

This project is using Interpenetrating Subsampling (IPS) approach to incorporate interpreter variability into estimation of the total variance of land cover area estimates. Two sampling design -- simple random sampling and sratified random sampling were considered. 
The R code file SRS_6group.R demostrate the estimation of total variance using IPS of simple random samples with 6 groups, the example dataset used in this case is Groups_6_Binary.csv.
