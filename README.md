# IPS-approach

This project is using Interpenetrating Subsampling (IPS) approach to incorporate interpreter variability into estimation of the total variance of land cover area estimates. Two sampling design -- simple random sampling and sratified random sampling were considered. 
The R code file SRS_6groups.R demostrate the estimation of total variance using IPS of simple random sample with 6 groups, the example dataset used in this case is Groups_6_Binary.csv. In Groups_6_Binary.csv, the binary reference labels provided by six different interpreters were recorded, with 1--target land cover class and 0--nontarget land cover class (for example, forest=1, nonforest=0). 
The R code file STR_3groups.R demostrate the estimation of total variance using IPS of stratified random sample with 3 groups, the example dataset used in this case is Group_3_for STR.csv. In Group_3_for STR.csv, the map labels and reference labels for three groups were recorded, the dataset contains four strata -- forest (was labeled 6), Developed (was labeled 2), Agriculture (was labeled 8), and others (was labeled 0).
